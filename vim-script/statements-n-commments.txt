Vimscript statements
====================

  • all statements are terminated by newline
  • statements continuation marker is a single backslash at the
    begining of the lined continued

        call SetName(
        \   first_name,
        \   middle_initial,
        \   family_name
        \ )

  • statements deliminator is a pipe charector (not the semicolon [1])

        echo "Staring..." | call Phase(1) | call Phase(2) | echo "Done"

[1] semicolon has meaning at the start of a command:
    it is a part of the command's line range "from the current line to...

Comments
========

    Comments start with a double-qoute and end at the end of line:

        if exists("g:syntax_on")
            syntaxoff      "Not 'syntax clear' (which does something else)
        else
            syntaxenable   "Not 'syntax on' (which overrides colorscheme)
        endif

    [!] However, double-quote also used to enclose strings, which
        take precedence over command. This means you can't put
        a comment anywhere that a string might be expected:

            echo "> " "Print a prompt
                                     ^--- missing closing double-quote

        In the above, the echo command expected a forth double-quote
        to close of second string, and produce error

        To get around this situation you can use delimiter:

            echo "> " | "Print a prompt
