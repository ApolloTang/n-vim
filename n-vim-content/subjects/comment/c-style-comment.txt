5.3. Comments

VIM also allows you to auto-format comments. You can split comments
into 3 stages: The first part, the middle part and the end part
 For example your coding style requirements may require comments
to be in the following style

	    /*
	    * This is the comment
	    */

In such a case the following command can be used

	    :set comments=sl:/*,mb:*,elx:*/

Let me decipher the command for you. The commands has three parts
 The first part is sl:/*. This tells VIM that three piece comments
begin with /*. The next part tells VIM that the middle part of
the comment is *. The last part of the command tells vim a couple
of things. One that the command should end with */ and that it
should automatically complete the comment when you hit just /.

Let me give another example. Lets say your coding guidelines are as follows

	    /*
	    ** This is the comment
	    */

In such a situation you can use following command for comments

	    :set comments=sl:/*,mb:**,elx:*

to insert a comment just type /* and hit enter. The next line
will automatically contain the **. After you've finished the
comment just hit enter again and another ** will be inserted. However
to end the comment you want a */ and not **/. VIM is quite clever
here. You don't need to delete the last * and replace it with
/. Instead, just hit / and VIM will recognise it as the end of
the comment and will automatically change the line from ** to */.
