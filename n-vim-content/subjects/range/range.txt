type  ":help 10.3" for range documentation

"1,$" is synonim to "%"

Using a pattern in a range:

    Perform subtitution between lines contains "section 1" and "section 2"
    (inclusive).

        :/section 1/,/section 2/:s/hello/bye/gc

    All lines between Section 1 and Section 2, non-inclusively, i.e. the lines
    containing Section 1 and Section 2 will not be affected.

        :/section 1/+,/section 2/-:s/hello/bye/gc



    The /pattern/ and ?pattern? may be followed by another address separated by a
    semicolon. A semicolon between two search patterns tells Vim to find the
    location of the first pattern, then start searching from that location for the
    second pattern.

        /Section 1/;/Subsection/-,/Subsection/+

        first find Section 1, then the first line with Subsection, step one
        line up (beginning of the range) and find the next line with
        Subsection, step one line down (end of the range).

    The next example shows how you can reuse you search pattern:


    Search for the Section line and yank (copy) one line after into the memory.

        :/Section/+ y

    Search for the next Section line and put (paste) the saved text on the next line.

        :// normal P
