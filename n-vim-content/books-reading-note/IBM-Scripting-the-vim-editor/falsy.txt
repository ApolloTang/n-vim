Only the numeric value zero is false in a boolean context;
any non­zero numeric value—whether positive or negative—is considered
true.

However, all the logical and comparison operators consistently
return the value 1 for true.

When a string is used as a boolean, it is first converted to
an integer, and then evaluated for truth (non­zero) or falsehood
(zero).

This implies that the vast majority of strings (including
most non­empty strings) will evaluate as being false. A typical
mistake is to test for an empty string like so:


    let result_string = GetResult();
    if !result_string
        echo "No result"
    endif
