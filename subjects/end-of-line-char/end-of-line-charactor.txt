Vim typically figures out the fileformat for you automatically. A file with

\r\n  --> dos
\r    --> mac
\n    --> unix

when a file contains BOTH \r\n and \n linefeeds,
	Vim declares it as a UNIX file and displays the ^M (\r) characters.

	These mixed-EOL files come about from stuff edited in different
    editors: some editors only save the lines actually changed
    converting only part of the file to DOS-style or MAC-style line
    endings. This also happens with files generated by user-written
    programs if a consistent mechanism for line termination isn't used


Here is the trick to remove all the ^M's.

You must be in command mode (From normal mode and press :(colon) to enter command mode)

	set fileformat=mac

Save and restart Vim for the changes to take effect. (simply refreshing does not work. I don't know why)

	In Cygwin or unix, you can convert a file INFILE in DOS format
	to a file OUTFILE in Unix format by calling:

		> tr -d '\15' < INFILE > OUTFILE
