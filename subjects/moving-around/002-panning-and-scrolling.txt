Pan (cursor moves with page)

  (n)zt         " Pan current line to top of screen
  (n)zz         " Pan current line to middle of screen
  (n)zb         " Pan current line to top of screen

      Note that the following are equivalent
      --------------------------------------
      (n)zt = (n)z<return>  " Pan current line to top of screen
      (n)zz = (n)z.         " Pan current line to middle of screen
      (n)zb = (n)z-         " Pan current line to top of screen


Move cursor to:

  (n)H          " move cursor to top of page
  (n)M          " move cursor to mid of page
  (n)L          " move cursor to botton of page


Move something to current cursor position (cursor does not move, page move):

  (n)<c-D>      " move next half a page to current curson position
  (n)<c-U>      " move previous  a page to current curson position

  (n)<c-F>      " move next     page to current curson position
  (n)<c-B>      " move previous page to current curson position

    But I have map
        <c-B> to "*y
        <c-F> to "*P
