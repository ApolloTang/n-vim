X11 Global store
    1. selections (own by application)
        1a. PRIMARY (use by "*, copy/paste w mouse highlight/middle button)
        1b. SECONDARY (ill-defiened x11 spec, not use by vim)
        1c. CLIPBOARD (use by "+, used by application cut/copy/paste, not available in xterm)
    2. cut-buffers (own by x-server)
        There are 8 cut-buffers: CUT_BUFFER0..CUT_BUFFER7



You can :set clipboard=unnamed or :set clipboard=unnamedplus to make
all yanking/deleting operations automatically copy to the system clipboard.
This could be an inconvenience in some cases where you have already storing
something else in the clipboard as it will override it.


Here are how registed are use:

"" the unamed register:
-----------------------

   [copying to unnamed reg]

       The unamed register will fill with:

          • text deleted with "d", "dd", "c", "s", "x", "X", "r" commands
          • text copy with "y", "yy"

       Text are copy to this register regardless of whether or not
       other register was used ( however, one exception is the '_' register).

   [pasting from unname reg]

        When pasting text with 'P' or 'p" command without specify a register,
        the content of unname register is paste to your buffer.

        Although unecessary, you can specfiy unamed register
        with double quote with 'p' or 'P' like '""P' or '""p'.

The number register: "0 to "9
-----------------------------

 • Numbered register 0 contains the text from the most recent yank command ('y' or 'yy').
 • Numbered register 1 contains the text form the most recent deleted *LINE* or change *LINE* command.

       However, the above will not happened if the commands (yanks, deleted line or change line)
       specified a specific register. In this case, text will go to the specified register.

       Note that, the above mentioned "*LINE*". If the deletion is less than a line,
       the text goes to '-', teh small deletion buffer.






    "1 recent (line) delete
    "* recent yank and delete (with :set clipboard=unamed)
    "- recent delete less then one line

Copying/pasting from the system clipboard will not work if
    :echo has('clipboard') returns 0.
