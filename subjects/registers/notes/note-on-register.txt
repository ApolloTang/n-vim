X11 Global store
    1. selections (own by application)
        1a. PRIMARY (use by "*, copy/paste w mouse highlight/middle button)
        1b. SECONDARY (ill-defiened x11 spec, not use by vim)
        1c. CLIPBOARD (use by "+, used by application cut/copy/paste, not available in xterm)
    2. cut-buffers (own by x-server)
        There are 8 cut-buffers: CUT_BUFFER0..CUT_BUFFER7



You can :set clipboard=unnamed or :set clipboard=unnamedplus to make 
all yanking/deleting operations automatically copy to the system clipboard. 
This could be an inconvenience in some cases where you have already storing 
something else in the clipboard as it will override it.


Here are how my registed are use currently:
    "" recent d, c, s, x, y
    "0 recent yank
    "1 recent (line) delete
    "* recent yank and delete (with :set clipboard=unamed)
    "- recent delete less then one line

Copying/pasting from the system clipboard will not work if 
    :echo has('clipboard') returns 0.
